1. What is LC2?

LC2 is a semi-analytic light curve code based on the light curve model of Arnett & Fu (1989). 
The code is capable of creating a large variety of SN light curves in a quick and efficient way. 
LC2 can also be used to get a rough, order-of-magnitude estimates on the physical parameters of 
core collapse SNe, including Type IIb SNe with double-peaked light curves. The SN IIb model is 
based on a two-component configuration, which contains a dense, inner region (core) and an extended, 
low-mass outer envelope (shell). In this configuration the adiabatic cooling of the shell dominates 
the early phase of the light curve, while after the first peak the light curve is governed by the 
decay of the radioactive Ni+Co. It is assumed that the radioacitve heating acts only in the center 
of the core, but does not affect the adiabatic cooling of the shock-heated outer shell. It is also 
possible to use the energy input of a magnetar spin-down, instead of the Ni+Co decay, as an 
alternative energy source in the core. The shape of the observed light curve is given as the sum 
of the emission from the outer envelope and the radiative diffusion from the centrally-heated 
inner core. The full description of LC2 model are documented in 
Nagy et al., A&A 571, 77 (2014) and  Nagy & Vinko, submitted to A&A (2016).  


2.How to install LC2?

You don't need to install any special program or library to work with LC2. Thus, all you need to use 
this code is a C compiler.


3.How to make a model with LC2?

To estimate the initial parameters of the progenitor, you have to fit the entire quasi-bolometric light curve 
of the SN with two-component configuration models. For this, you need to modify separately the input parameter
file of the core (par_core.inp) and the shell (par_shell.inp). After that, you only need to compile the 
code with "./run", which creates the light curve of both the core and the shell, as well as the combined 
bolometric light curve. 


4.What are the initial parameters?

There are several input parameters in the LC2 code:

--> R0: Initial maximal radius (in cm)
--> Mej: Ejected mass (in solar mass)
--> Trec: Recombination temperature (in K) 
--> MNi: Initial nickel mass (in solar mass) 
--> Ekin: Kinetic energy of the explosion (in 10^51 erg)
--> Eth: Thermal energy of the explosion (in 10^51 erg)
--> a: Exponential density profile exponent (a >= 0, see below) 
--> n: Power-law density profile exponent (n >= 0, see below)
--> kappa: Thompson-scattering opacity (in cm^2/g)
--> Ep: Initial rotational energy of the magnetar (in 10^51 erg)
--> tp: Characteristic time scale of magnetar spin-down (in day) 
--> Ag: Characteristic time scale of gamma-leakage (in day^2). 
--> tmax: Final epoch of the model light curve (in day).

Most important parameter settings and constraints:

--> R0 must be greater for the shell than for the core
--> Mej should be much lower for the shell than for the core
--> Recombination in the core can be switched off by setting T_rec = 0
--> Trec = 5000 K works for H-rich inner core
--> Trec between 8000 and 10000 K may be used for He-rich inner core   
--> MNi = 0 is assumed for the shell; MNi only affects the light curve from the core
--> To use the exponential density profile, a > 0 must be set
--> LC2 only uses the exponential density profile if n = 0 
--> n > 0 turns on the power-law density profile ( n = 3 and n = 5 are forbidden! )
--> The magnetar energy input can be switched off by setting  Ep = 0 and tp = 0
--> The gamma-leakage can be ignored by setting Ag large, for example Ag = 1e10
 
 
5.What is the configuration of the output file?  

The "run script" creates 3 output file:
--> core.out,
--> shell.out,
--> comb.out.

The structures of "core.out" and "shell.out" are similar. These files contain the values of 
the initial parameters and some calculated physical properties in the header, followed by the 
calculated bolometric luminosities for the core and the shell component, respectively.
 
The calculated physical properties:
--> v: Maximal expansion velocity (in km/s)
--> rho0: Initial central density (in g/cm^3)
--> td: Time scale for radiative diffusion (in day)
--> th: Hydrodynamic time scale (= R0 / v, in day)
--> t0: Effective diffusion time scale or "light-curve time scale" (= sqrt(2*th*td), in day)

In "core.out" and "shell.out" the different columns contain the following time-dependent 
physical quantities:
--> t: Time since shock breakout (in day)
--> Lsn: Total calculated luminosity (in erg/s)
--> logLsn: log10( Lsn )
--> Ldiff: Luminosity from radiative diffusion of radioactive decay and/or magnetar input (in erg/s)
--> Lrec: Luminosity from the recombination process (in erg/s)
--> xi: Instantaneous radius of the recombination front in co-moving coordinate system 
    (xi=1 if the front is at R_max)

The structure of "comb.out" is much simpler. In this case the 1st column is the time elapsed from shock breakout.
The 2nd column is the total luminosity of the core model, while the 3rd column is the total luminosity of the 
shell model. Thus, the combined light curve can be constructed as the sum of the 2nd and 3rd columns of
comb.out.
